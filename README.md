**Human + AI Musical Symbiosis System**

A collaborative live-coding environment where an AI composer/DJ pairs with a human musician to create electronic music in real-time using Strudel and integrated audio libraries.

## Vision

AI (Cursor) acts as composer and DJ. Human provides nervous-system feedback loop for musical quality assessment. Together, we explore the boundaries of human-AI creative collaboration.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Strudel (live coding environment)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + WebSocket (real-time collaboration)
- **Audio**: Strudel, Web Audio API, custom samples & plugins
- **Development**: Local Cursor IDE integration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start backend server
cd backend
npm run dev

# Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Initial Setup Phase** - Building foundation for collaborative music creation

## Philosophy

*"The human brings the nervous system. The AI brings infinite ideas. Together, we make music that neither could make alone."*
