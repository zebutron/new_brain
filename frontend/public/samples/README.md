# Dirt-Samples

Set of samples used in SuperDirt and the TidalCycles tutorials. The
folders collect different kinds of samples:

* single hits of tuned instruments (arpy)
* single hits of different instruments (gretsch)
* single hits of the same instrument to capture is varying behavior (bd)
* a sequence of different hits on a single (co)
* loops and loops cut to slices (breaks125, amencutup)

...or everything at the same time.

Note: There are duplicates among the files. One way to find them is running

```
rmlint --types=duplicates -p
```

We keep everything as it is to not break existing artwork.
