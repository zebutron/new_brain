# Compositional Guide - Human Feedback Patterns

## What the Human Values

### Groove and Rhythm
- **Syncopation** - Not just straight beats, funk and swing
- **Variation** - Patterns that evolve, not static loops
- **Space** - Sparse patterns breathe better than dense
- **Humanization** - Slight variations, not machine-perfect

### Sound Design
- **Audibility** - If it's a bass, it needs to be HEARD
- **Grit** - Industrial sounds need distortion, resonance, character
- **Clarity** - Each element should have its place in the mix
- **Appropriate effects** - Don't over-reverb everything

### Melody and Harmony
- **Avoid corny** - Simple major inversions feel cheesy
- **Tension** - Dissonance, chromatic movement, unresolved chords
- **Counterpoint** - Melody moves when bass rests, creates space
- **Memorable** - Repeatable hooks, not random chaos
- **Context-appropriate** - Dark vibes need minor keys and tension

### Structure
- **Clear sections** - A/B structure with distinct character
- **Purpose** - Each section should DO something (build, drop, release)
- **Proper length** - 4-bar phrases are standard, not 1-bar
- **Transitions matter** - Drops should feel like drops

## Feedback Patterns Observed

### When AI Gets It Wrong:

**"Too corny/repetitive"**
- Simple major chord inversions
- Predictable patterns without variation
- Overly happy/bright tonality

**"Not audible"**
- Bass too low (G0 vs G1-G2 range)
- Not enough gain or presence
- Buried in the mix

**"Too intense/square"**
- Dense patterns without space
- Constant fast notes with no breathing room
- Mechanical feel

**"Not working as intended"**
- Strudel syntax errors
- Structure not matching description
- Technical issues vs creative issues

### When AI Gets It Right:

**"This works great, save it!"**
- Good groove with syncopation
- Appropriate sound design for vibe
- Memorable melodic content
- Clean, working code

**"This is cool, but..."**
- Foundation is good, needs adjustment
- Right idea, wrong execution
- Keep the vibe, fix the details

## Best Practices Learned

### Basslines
1. **Pitch range**: G1-G2 for audible industrial bass, not G0
2. **Layering**: Combine sawtooth (grit) + sine (sub) + square (mid)
3. **Movement**: Chromatic creeping creates tension
4. **Effects**: Resonance + distortion for industrial character
5. **Rhythm**: Guitar-like syncopation, not static drones

### Drums
1. **Foundation**: 4-on-floor kick for dance, half-time for heavy
2. **Snare**: On 2 and 4, add variation for interest
3. **Hi-hats**: Mix of 16ths, 8ths, quarters for groove
4. **Accents**: Claps, snaps, percussion with delay
5. **Space**: Sparse patterns groove better

### Melodies
1. **Range**: Match the vibe (high for ethereal, mid for angst)
2. **Rhythm**: Mix sustained notes with fast runs
3. **Harmony**: Minor keys for dark, chromatic for tension
4. **Effects**: LFO modulation for movement and interest
5. **Purpose**: Counterpoint the bass, don't double it

### Structure
1. **Use explicit patterns** when angle brackets fail
2. **Test incrementally** - build up complexity
3. **Save working versions** before major changes
4. **Listen to feedback** - if it's not working, simplify

## Genre-Specific Notes

### Industrial/NIN
- Minor keys, chromatic movement
- Heavy distortion and resonance
- Dark chord progressions (no resolution)
- LFO modulation for unease
- Sparse arrangements with reverb

### Daft Punk/Funk
- Funky syncopated basslines
- 4-on-floor with tight drums
- Short punchy sounds
- Clear, bright, energetic
- Nostalgic synth tones

### General Dance
- Clear kick and snare
- Variation in hi-hats
- Melodic hooks that repeat
- Build and release sections
- Room for elements to breathe
